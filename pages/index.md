# tl;dr



All my adult life I've built projects. This past 2 years mainly focusing on agentic and web3 tools, using Python, Rust, TypeScript, LangGraph and Solana ecosystem. I don't have much hobbies other than building stuff, sticking to my screen and getting my dopamine from "build:success".

## Journey

I'm Yash from Bangalore/Delhi, 2024 CSE grad. I started as a 3D-blender-artist/dev [art-portfolio](https://yasv.artstation.com/) that's what sparked my respect for NFT-web3-crypto world.

After that I shifted to Python for algo-trading, did 3 internships (micro-teams) in this field, learned a lot about production APIs (FastAPI), data engineering pipelines and bliss in hard work.

Then started working as a full-time software developer (mostly on data pipelines, LMS infra, notification system and some automations) at a mid level startup that got dissolved after a year.

Now I'm learning web3 infra development mainly using TypeScript-Rust-Anchor-Solana.

I'm all in on the NetworkState dream.
