# tl;dr

All my adult life I've built projects. This past 2 years mainly focusing on AI application systems and agentic workflows using Python, LangGraph, FastAPI, and TypeScript. I don't have many hobbies other than building stuff, sticking to my screen, and getting my dopamine from "build:success".

## Journey

I'm Yash from Bangalore/Delhi, 2024 CSE grad. I started as a 3D-blender-artist/dev [art-portfolio](https://yasv.artstation.com/) that's what sparked my respect for creativity, systems, and automation.

After that I shifted to Python for algo-trading, did 3 internships (micro-teams) in this field, learned a lot about production APIs (FastAPI), data engineering pipelines, and the bliss in hard work.

Then started working as a full-time software developer (mostly on data pipelines, LMS infra, notification system, and internal automations) at a mid-level startup that got dissolved after a year.

Now Iâ€™m deep into building AI-first systems mostly around LangGraph-based agentic architectures, orchestration, reasoning pipelines, and experimental automation tools.

Preparing me'self for ai-world-domination/abomination.
